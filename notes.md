Naming things

- Convey meaning, intent
- Consistency
- Don't abbreviate
- If naming is hard, maybe method/class is doing too much

isMachine

- "is" beginning implies boolean

What is the meaning of this?

- Comments (Why, not What)
- Clear API
- Self documenting

Avoiding complexity

- Object calisthenics
- Avoid 'else'
- Every dev is a designer

Simplicity is relative

- Junior vs. Senior
- Abstractions and small pieces harder to follow for junior

Code is written once, but read many times

- Easier to test, fix bugs, maintain
- Future is the most important thing (most of the time)
- Someone (most of the time you) will have to maintain the code

Ask yourself

- Read each line/method/class in isolation

Metrics

- Mess detector, pdepend, sonar
- Development by the numbers (Anthony)

Code Review

- Peer feedback
- Lead developer

Future is the most important thing

- Things will change
- Make code that is easy to change

Constant Refactoring

- When adding new features, fixing bugs
- Design patterns
- YAGNI, Remove unused code
- Facade (hide complexity)
